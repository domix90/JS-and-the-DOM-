If I want to remove paragraph from the dom and I have the following: 

let paragraph = document.getElementByID('myParagraph');

I can remove child by using 

parent.removeChild(paragraph);

But the problem is that I do not know what the parent is. So to get a REFERENCE to a parent node I can use 

element.parentNode and assign in to a variable like that: 

let parentToParagraph = paragraph.parentNode;

and then use: 

parentToParagraph.removeChild(paragraph);
