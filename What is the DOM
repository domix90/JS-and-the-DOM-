JavaScript's global environment is full of controls your code can use to make things happen. 
These controls come in the form of JavaScript objects and functions. 
Inside a browser, they allow your code to see and manipulate web pages.

DOM stands for Document Object Model. 
The DOM is a representation of a webpage that JavaScript can use. 
Changes that JavaScript makes to the DOM alter the web page.


Document Object Model (DOM) represents a webpage that JS can use just like a city map which is a model of a city. 
Dom is a map of a webpage that JS can use. Unlike the map, the DOM is a live entity which means that any changes to the DOM alters the webpage. 


The document is a global object representing HTML content of a webpage.
In JS you can select particular parts of the webpage by interacting with the document. 


Global scope - window object. The main global variable that we can work with is document object. Document is a property of the window object.
