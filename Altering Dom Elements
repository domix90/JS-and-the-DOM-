1. I can change get and change the text of the document by using 

Element.textContent and Element.innerHTML 

While .textContent can only alter the text .innerHTML can alter any Nodes on the page. 

2. Using .type or .className property I can change the element's class name or type.

3. Using .style property I change style of an element inline without the use of external files. The inline gets priority over the external file.

For instance I can make an element like <div> disappear on the page by setting its .style property to element.style.display = "none";


4. Creating an element with createElement does not make that element appear immediately on the page. 

document.create('h1'); will create a new h1 on the page
